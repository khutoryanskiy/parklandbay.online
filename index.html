I hope you guys voted and are gonna go to the meeting tonight!  If you CAN’T make it in person tonight, PLEASE make sure you fill out your vote AND your proxy and drop them off at the office today before 5:30.  If you don’t drop hand in your proxy, your vote won’t count.  
You have to fill out the proxy form, put your address on the blank line and then print and sign your name and put it in the proxy envelope and drop off at clubhouse today before 5:30 for your vote to count.  Please make sure you do this 🙏 

We need 120 people to show up in-person(or have their proxies properly done and turned in by 5:30 today) to have quorum to move the election forward.

Again, the ballot is one thing and the proxy is another.  Please make sure to do this properly if you can’t make it tonight 🙏
